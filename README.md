# ***Retail Data Analytics : Products, Sales & Customers***

# *Overview*
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales, products, and customer behavior using SQL. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we extract key business insights that help in understanding sales performance, customer trends, and product demand.
The project is divided into four sections:

- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Initial data exploration and trends.

- *Advanced Analysis* – In-depth SQL queries for deeper insights.

- *Customer Report* – Customer behavior, segmentation, and purchasing trends.

- *Product Report* – Product sales performance, top-selling items, and inventory insights.

# *Objective*

The main objectives of this project are:

- Identify key sales trends and performance metrics.

- Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

- Examine product demand and best-selling items.

- Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.
